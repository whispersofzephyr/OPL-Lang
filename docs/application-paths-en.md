# 🚀 Application Paths & Deployment Layers

---

## 1. Overview

OPL‑Lang is not just a syntax — it is a structural foundation for building real-world option strategy tools.

To support different use cases and technical capacities, the language defines **three strategic construction paths**, each reflecting a different mode of deployment:

| Path | Target Use | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 🔹 **Path A** | Human interaction / UI app / Machine-compatible | A logic-tree-based strategy builder, guided by trader intent |
| 🔸 **Path B** | Machine generation | Compiles intent and constraints into structured multi-leg strategies |
| 🔺 **Path C** | Reverse solving | Uses target Greeks or outcome profiles to infer or synthesize valid structures |

These paths allow developers to choose implementation levels based on available resources and desired sophistication.

## 2. Tiered Deployment Structure

We outline two main **deployment tiers**, aligned with the above paths.

### 🧩 Tier 1: Human-Facing Path A App

**Ideal for:** solo developers, small teams, education platforms, power traders

**Workflow:**

This can be implemented via an interactive questionnaire or multiple-choice interface, allowing users to revise inputs and instantly see adjusted strategies.

1. User selects directional bias (bullish, bearish, non-directional), expected price target for underlying asset, expected time frame.
2. System initializes the strategy system with the first one or two legs based on user input. The system optionally suggests strike/tenor and expiration date based on human-validated templates.
3. User inputs subsequent strategy constraints such as risk tolerance, premium recovery, and reduced maximum profit.
4. System presents leg options in logic-tree steps according to the user’s input (e.g. buy call → add hedge → add credit leg).
5. When each leg is added, the system optionally suggests strike/tenor and expiration date based on familiar strategy templates (verticals, calendars, collars).
6. Risk filters, capital use, and payoff validation are presented.
7. Resulting strategy is rendered and optionally exported or priced.

**Notes:**

- This tier **does not require full Greek calculation**.
- It leverages intuitive templates and familiar constructs.
- Core advantage is **educational clarity + structured consistency**.

### 🧩 Tier 1.5: Path A+ – Machine-Enhanced Strategy Generation

**Ideal for:** quant research groups, platforms, institutions

**Workflow:**

1. User selects directional bias, price target, and expected timeframe.
2. User inputs strategy constraints such as risk tolerance, premium recovery, and maximum profit tradeoffs.
3. User applies reality-check filters: risk/reward ratio, capital efficiency, option liquidity, etc.
4. System executes strategy assembly step-by-step.
5. System initializes the first one or two legs with Greeks validation for strike and expiration selection.
6. System adds legs in logic-tree steps based on input, using Greek-based screening at each decision point.
7. If any constraint fails, the system adjusts or backtracks legs to restore validity.
8. Final strategy is rendered and optionally priced/exported.

### ⚙️ Tier 2: Compiler‑Level Path B/C Engine

**Ideal for:** quant research groups, platforms, institutions

**Workflow:**

- Path B: Accepts intent (e.g. “bullish with limited downside risk”) and constraints (e.g. max risk < $X) → compiles structure.
- Path C: Accepts target response (e.g. delta-neutral with positive theta) → infers structure via reverse logic.

**Requires:**

- Structural reasoning + Greek model
- Local optimizers or heuristics (e.g. shift strike, roll tenor, add/remove legs)
- Simulation or constraint verification modules

**Output:**

- Fully validated strategy structure
- Possibly integrated with pricing engines, execution platforms, or backtesters

## 3. Developer Roadmap & Suggestions

| Scale | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Just starting? | Build a logic-tree Path A prototype using human-readable JSON |
| UI designer? | Create an interactive “strategy wizard” using Path A steps |
| Quant dev? | Try implementing enhanced Path A+ or Path B for a single intent + constraint case |
| Educational platform? | Use Path A to let users explore strategies with structural guidance |
| Institutional tool builder? | Implement Path C as a backend engine to power Greek-based strategy suggestions |

---

## 4. Examples & Inspiration

| Example Use Case | Path | Description |
|------------------|------|-------------|
| Web app to build vertical spreads | A | UI-guided tree, common templates |
| Engine to suggest low-risk bullish setups | A+ or B | Compiles structure from risk + intent |
| Tool to maintain delta-neutral position | C | Reverse solve to offset Δ dynamically |
| Classroom module on option strategies | A | Helps learners see structural logic |

---

## 5. Final Notes

The power of OPL‑Lang lies in its separation of **structure**, **intent**, and **response behavior**.

Whether you're building an educational interface, a constraint-aware compiler, or an intelligent strategy engine, OPL‑Lang offers a unified foundation for clean, scalable, and intent-driven expression.

# 🚀 Application Paths & Deployment Layers

---

## 1. Overview

OPL‑Lang is not just a syntax — it is a structural foundation for building real-world option strategy tools.

To support different use cases and technical capacities, the language defines **three strategic construction paths**, each reflecting a different mode of deployment:

| Path | Target Use | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 🔹 **Path A** | Human interaction / UI app / Machine-compatible | A logic-tree-based strategy builder, guided by trader intent |
| 🔸 **Path B** | Machine generation | Compiles intent and constraints into structured multi-leg strategies |
| 🔺 **Path C** | Reverse solving | Uses target Greeks or outcome profiles to infer or synthesize valid structures |

These paths allow developers to choose implementation levels based on available resources and desired sophistication.

## 2. Tiered Deployment Structure

We outline two main **deployment tiers**, aligned with the above paths.

### 🧩 Tier 1: Human-Facing Path A App

**Ideal for:** solo developers, small teams, education platforms, power traders

**Workflow:**

Can be implemented via interactive questionnaires or multiple-choice UI. Users can revise inputs in real time and instantly see updated strategy structures.

1. User selects directional bias (bullish, bearish, neutral), target price level, and timeframe.
2. System initializes the first one or two legs based on input, optionally recommending strike and expiration using human-validated templates.
3. User defines additional strategy constraints: max risk tolerance, whether to recover premium, whether reduced max profit is acceptable.
4. System guides user through strategy building via a logic tree (e.g. buy call → add hedge → add credit leg).
5. Each added leg can use predefined human-validated strategy templates (verticals, calendars, collars) to suggest strike/tenor.
6. Risk filters, capital usage, and expected payoff validations are shown.
7. Final strategy is rendered, and may be exported or priced.

**Notes:**

- Path A uses human-validated templates based on common trader experience.
- This tier **does not require full Greeks calculation**, since strategy templates already encode reasonable Greeks sensitivity profiles.
- The main advantages are **educational clarity and structural consistency**.

### 🧩 Tier 1.5: Path A+ – Machine-Enhanced Strategy Generation

**Ideal for:** quant research groups, trading platforms, institutions

**Workflow:**

1. User selects directional bias, price target, and time horizon.
2. User defines structural constraints: max risk, cost-saving preference, willingness to cap profit, etc.
3. User applies additional filters: risk/reward ratio, capital efficiency, option liquidity, etc.
4. System automatically runs the logic-tree-based builder, step by step.
5. The first legs are initialized with Greeks validation (strike and tenor selected to ensure sensitivity balance).
6. Each additional step uses Greeks-aware logic to propose and validate legs.
7. If any constraint fails, the system backtracks or modifies legs to meet all criteria.
8. Final strategy is rendered and optionally exported or priced.

**Notes:**

- A+ does not rely on static human-validated templates, but dynamically builds and validates strategies step-by-step.
- Every change to strike, expiration, or number of legs is driven by the cumulative Greek profile of the entire strategy.
- This enables more complex and precise structures than traditional human-validated templates, while maintaining compatibility with OPL‑Lang semantic logic.

### ⚙️ Tier 2: Compiler‑Level Path B / C Engine

**Ideal for:** quant platforms, automated strategy systems, algorithmic structure design teams

**Workflow:**

- **Path B:** Accepts trader intent (e.g. “bullish but risk-capped”) + structural constraints (e.g. “max loss < $X”) → compiles strategy structure. Then use Greeks profile target to make changes to the strategy structure, adjusting strike price, expiration date, add or remove or replace legs. 
- **Path C:** Accepts target behavior profile (e.g. “delta-neutral and theta-positive”) → reverse solves for valid structures based on Greek response.

**Requirements:**

- Structural inference engine + Greek model
- Local optimizers or heuristics (e.g. adjust strike, roll expiration, add/remove legs)
- Simulation or constraint validation modules

**Output:**

- Fully verified strategy structures
- Compatible with pricing engines, execution systems, or backtest modules

**Notes:**

- B and C do not depend on any pre-built human templates.
- Compared to A+, Path B allows **global structural optimization**, using post-construction Greek balancing.
- Path C enables **behavior-first design**, solving for strategy structure from target risk characteristics.

## 3. Developer Roadmap & Suggestions

| Scale | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Just starting? | Build a logic-tree Path A prototype using human-readable JSON |
| UI designer? | Create an interactive “strategy wizard” using Path A steps |
| Quant dev? | Try implementing enhanced Path A+ or Path B for a single intent + constraint case |
| Educational platform? | Use Path A to let users explore strategies with structural guidance |
| Institutional tool builder? | Implement Path C as a backend engine to power Greek-based strategy suggestions |

## 4. Examples & Inspiration

| Example Use Case | Path | Description |
|------------------|------|-------------|
| Web app to build vertical spreads | A | UI-guided tree, common templates |
| Engine to suggest low-risk bullish setups | A+ or B | Compiles structure from risk + intent |
| Tool to maintain delta-neutral position | C | Reverse solve to offset Δ dynamically |
| Classroom module on option strategies | A | Helps learners see structural logic |

## 5. Final Notes

The power of OPL‑Lang lies in its separation of **structure**, **intent**, and **response behavior**.

Whether you're building an educational interface, a constraint-aware compiler, or an intelligent strategy engine, OPL‑Lang offers a unified foundation for clean, scalable, and intent-driven expression.
